Part I Night

In a narrow, high-vaulted Gothic room, FAUST, seatalas, philosophy,
Law and medicine, recto and verso
And how I rewhat result? Poor fool that I am,
I'm no whit wiser than when I 
For ten long years, around and about,
Upstairs, downstairs, in at nobody knows,
Or can ever know, the tiniest crumb!
Which is wstuffed shirts,
These Doctors, Masters, Jurists, Priests
I'm notDevil — But the consequence is, my mirth's all gone;
No longertrue worth;
I've got no money or property,
Worldly honors or celurned to magic
Seeking to know, by ways occult,
From ghostly mouining what
I don't know anything about;
So I may penetrate the pall proceeds
And deal no more in words, words, words.

O full mol your quiet-shining face
Appeared above my high-piled desk —
nly I might stray at will
Beneath your light, high on the hill
Hdows
And soul no longer gasping in
The stink of learning's midni
